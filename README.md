 # **Brew Brewery**
## **Purpose**
I created this website to promote a fictious Brewery called **Brew Brewery** this website focuses on the backstory of the company, the products that Brew Brewery offer and also a way to get in contact with the company.

Not all craft beer is good beer and finding good craft beer can be hard nowadays with the craft brewing market being highly oversaturated.

**Brew Brewery** was created with this in mind to offer customers an insight into our brewing process while also being able to view the products we have on offer and where to buy them.


The live website can be found [here](https://paullally.github.io/Milestone-1/).

### **Colour Scheme**

<h2 align=center id="top"><img src="assets/images/colours.png" max-height=200px></h2>

### **Typography**

- [**Montserrat:**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mont)
    - The primary font across the website, using four different weights: 400, 500, 700.
    - Montserrat was used for the main heading tags and the footer text elements. 
    - Montserrat was chosen due to is readablity for all users.

- [**Source Sans Pro**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro?preview.text_type=custom&query=sou)
    - The secondary font across the website.
    - Source Sans Pro was used for the Navigation bar Links and paragraphs in a font weight of 400.
    - Source Sans Pro was chosen for its readablity and compliments  Montserrat well.
- [**Permanent Marker**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Permanent+Marker?preview.text_type=custom&query=perm)
    - This font was used to created the logo text.
    - Permanent Marker was used on the navigation bar logo and the landing image logo.
    - This font was used due its distinct style and playfulness.  

### **Frameworks**
- [MDBoostrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/)
    - Taking the responsiveness of Bootstrap and the front-end UI of Materialize, MDBoostrap makes use of both of these. So all aspects of the site were clean and accessible for all users. 

- [JQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/)
    - In order to minimalize the amount of Javascript used across the application, I chose to implement a lot of the JS functionality with JQuery.

### **Icons**
- [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - All the icons used across this website were taken from Font Awesome and styled to match the colour scheme.
