 # **Brew Brewery**
## **Purpose**
I created this website to promote a fictious Brewery called **Brew Brewery** this website focuses on the backstory of the company, the products that Brew Brewery offer and also a way to get in contact with the company.

Not all craft beer is good beer and finding good craft beer can be hard nowadays with the craft brewing market being highly oversaturated.

**Brew Brewery** was created with this in mind to offer customers an insight into our brewing process while also being able to view the products we have on offer and where to buy them.


The live website can be found [here](https://paullally.github.io/Milestone-1/).
